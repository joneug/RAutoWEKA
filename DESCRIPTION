Description: An R interface to Auto-WEKA (Version 2.6.1).
   Many different machine learning algorithms exist that can easily be used off the shelf,
   many of these methods are implemented in the open source WEKA package (see
   <http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/>).
   However, each of these algorithms have their own hyperparameters that can drastically
   change their performance, and there are a staggeringly large number of possible alternatives overall.
   Auto-WEKA considers the problem of simultaneously selecting a learning algorithm and setting its
   hyperparameters, going beyond previous methods that address these issues in isolation.
   Auto-WEKA does this using a fully automated approach, leveraging recent innovations in Bayesian optimization.
